# Mangopear > Scenic Buses WordPress Theme

Version: 3.0.0

## Author:

## Summary

This website is a prototype directory for the most scenic bus routes in the UK.

This repo should always be using the latest (stable) version of WordPress. It also uses MangUI - the design-less framework from mangopear creative.

## Usage

The interesting parts of this website are the theme and the bespoke plugin for additional functionality.

### Theme

The theme uses Gulp to compile SCSS (with source maps), run it through [AutoPrefixr](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer), lint, concatenate and minify JavaScript (with source maps), optimise images and [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) the browser (with an extension), with flexibility to add any additional tasks via the Gulpfile.

Alternatively, you could use Codekit or PrePros to compile the SCSS and JavaScript (without source maps).

## Credits

Without these projects, this WordPress Starter Theme wouldn't be where it is today.
